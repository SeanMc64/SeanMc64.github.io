What factors or farm practices affect the susceptibility of dairy cows to sub-clinical vs clinical mastitis?


My thesis was part of a wider collaborative project between University College Dublin and Teagasc (Irish Agriculture and Food Development Authority). Mastitis is an illness effecting the udders in dairy cattle. It can appear as both clinical and subclinical. Subclinical cases are undetectable by traditional methods which can cause it to exist untreated in a herd for long periods of time, negatively impacting the herds output and the effected animal’s welfare. My research aimed on determining what factors affect a cow having a clinical versus subclinical mastitis infection.

I examined a dataset consisting of 1991 recorded mastitis infections, with 56 different factors recorded relating to physiological, and environmental factors associated to the cow at the time of the observed infection including details such as lactation stage, bacteria in the udder, and milk quality and quantity. The primary scope of this study was to provide valuable exploratory data analysis to Teagsc by examining the 56 different measured factors and determining if there is a difference in these factors between clinical and subclinical mastitis cases. Additionally, I created a mixed effects logistic regression classifier to classify infections as either clinical or subclinical mastitis with an accuracy of 91.2% for clinical cases and 85% for subclinical cases.

It was very rewarding to be able to provide exploratory data analysis that was then used as part of a larger Academic and Semi-State collaborative project aimed at in reducing the impact of mastitis infections in Ireland, and this explains why it took up such a large section of my thesis! Despite this, I was very satistifed to be the ﬁrst to examine the factors relating to a subclinical versus clinical diagnosis of mastitis in dairy cattle. Past studies have used mixed eﬀects logitic models to predict clinical infections, and others to predict subclinical infections, but this was the ﬁrst study examining the question of 'Given that a mastitis infection exists in a dairy cow, what factors relate to a subclinical versus a clinical mastitis diagnosis.'
